## Azure Portal

The `Azure portal` is one of several management tools used in the Azure ecosystem. It is a web-based, unified console that provides an alternative to command-line tools.

It is available in every datacenter. This makes it designed for resiliency, low access latency, and high availability.

You can manage your Azure subscription with the Azure portal.

Within this tool you can build, manage, and track everything from simple web apps to complex cloud deployments.

The Azure portal's home page houses a menu with 4 main links:

- Create a resource - allows you to create a new entity managed by Azure like a virtual machine or storage accounts.
- Home- redirects you to the portal's main page.
- Dashboard- Your dashboard is a place to manage all the major resources you use on Azure. You can also customize the dashboard.
- All services
